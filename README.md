# AirQualityProject
An interactive Python application (Tkinter-based GUI) for exploring global urban air quality data (1958–2025). Users can visualize trends in PM2.5 and NO₂ across cities, filter by country, city, year, and month, and make predictive estimations of air pollution levels using trained machine learning models.
